# hello-world

I used to use CVS many years ago so the terms used in GIT and GITHUB are very familiar.  I am now learning about GITHUB because I need to bring my skill set up to par (grammar stage).  There are a lot of new technologies that I need to be familiar with before moving on to a new project.
